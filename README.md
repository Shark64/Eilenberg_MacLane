# Eilenberg &amp;  MacLane _General Theory of Natural Equivalences_ typed in LaTeX

This repository contains the .tex source and .pdf version of Samule Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane's
1945 landmark paper that gave birth to category theory.
The scanned version of the original paper is kinda hard to read and (especially) print. So I've
retyped the whole paper using AMS LaTeX.
No attemp has been made to recreate the exact layout of the original paper. Borrowing a phrase from
MacLane's writing this is not an exact copy of the original paper, but a copy _"up to isomorphism"_ to 
(hopefully!) improve legibility over the original scanned version.

The pdf version is here: [General Theory Of Natural Equivalences](categories.pdf) 
the source code is also in the repository, for completeness.
