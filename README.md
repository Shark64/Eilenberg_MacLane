# Eilenberg &amp;  MacLane _General Theory of Natural Equivalences_ typeset in LaTeX

This repository contains the .tex source and .pdf version of Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane's
landmark paper from 1945 that gave birth to category theory.
The scanned version of the original paper is kinda hard to read, especially after printing. So I've
retyped the whole paper using AMS-LaTeX.

No attempt has been made to recreate the exact layout of the original paper. Borrowing a phrase from
MacLane's writing this is not an exact copy of the original paper, but a copy _"up to isomorphism"_ to 
(hopefully!) try to improve legibility over the original scanned version.

The pdf version is here: [General Theory Of Natural Equivalences](categories.pdf) 


the source code is also in the repository, for completeness.
